## Data Availability statement

Our dataset contains sensitive information because patients may be potentially identified from the dates of the study combined with the strict inclusion criteria used. The policies for data custody and anonymization were imposed and approved by all ethical committees in the three ICUs involved in our study: the Geneva Regional Research Ethics Committee (study number 14-041), the Ethical Committee of Hopital Erasme-Universite Libre de Bruxelles (study number P2014/171), and the Mutua de Terrassa ​ Hospital Institutional Review Board (study number EO/1407). For this reason, the Shockomics project has appointed a data access committee for data sharing. In compliance with PLoS One policies for data sharing, all requests should be addressed to:
